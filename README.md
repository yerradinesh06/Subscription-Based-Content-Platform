# 📘 Detailed Description of the Smart Contract

### Contract Name: **SubscriptionBasedContentPlatform**

### Language: Solidity (v0.8.19)

---

## 🎯 Purpose

This smart contract is designed to create a **decentralized subscription-based content platform** where:

* Users (subscribers) can purchase different **subscription tiers** to access premium content.
* Content creators can upload and publish digital content (stored as IPFS hashes or encrypted references).
* Creators receive **rewards** whenever their content is accessed, while the platform owner collects fees.

This eliminates intermediaries and ensures **transparency, automation, and security** in content monetization.

---

## 🛠️ Core Functionalities

### 1. **Subscription Management**

* **Purchase/Renew**:

  * Users can purchase subscriptions for different tiers (Basic, Premium, VIP).
  * Duration depends on the tier:

    * **Tier 1 (Basic):** 30 days
    * **Tier 2 (Premium):** 60 days
    * **Tier 3 (VIP):** 90 days
* **Payment Validation**: Users must send enough Ether (subscriptionPrice × tier).
* **Extension Logic**: If a user renews before expiration, the new duration is **added** to their existing subscription.

---

### 2. **Content Creation & Publishing**

* **Content Creator Approval**: Only addresses approved by the owner can upload content.
* **Upload Details**: Each content has:

  * Unique `contentId`
  * Title (string)
  * `contentHash` (IPFS or encrypted reference)
  * Creator’s address
  * Required tier (1–3)
  * Timestamp and active status
* **Deactivation**: A creator or the owner can deactivate content.

---

### 3. **Content Access**

* Subscribers can **access content** only if:

  * Their subscription is active.
  * Their tier is **equal to or higher** than the content’s required tier.
* When accessed:

  * The creator earns rewards (90%).
  * The platform keeps a fee (10%).
* Access returns the **contentHash**, enabling decentralized storage solutions like IPFS.

---

### 4. **Earnings & Withdrawals**

* **Creators**:

  * Accumulate earnings based on content views.
  * Can withdraw earnings anytime.
* **Owner**:

  * Collects platform fees from all transactions.
  * Can withdraw the total contract balance.

---

### 5. **Platform Control & Security**

* **Owner Controls**:

  * Add/Remove content creators.
  * Update subscription price.
  * Withdraw platform fees.
  * Pause/Unpause the platform (emergency stop).
* **Modifiers for Security**:

  * `onlyOwner` → Restricts functions to the owner.
  * `onlyContentCreator` → Restricts publishing to approved creators.
  * `hasActiveSubscription` → Ensures a subscriber has a valid plan.
  * `whenNotPaused` → Disables functionality during pause state.

---

## 📊 Data Structures

* **Structs**

  * `Subscription`: Stores `isActive`, `expirationDate`, `subscriptionTier`.
  * `Content`: Stores `contentId`, `title`, `contentHash`, `creator`, `requiredTier`, `createdAt`, `isActive`.

* **Mappings**

  * `subscriptions` → Maps subscriber address to subscription.
  * `contents` → Maps contentId to content details.
  * `contentCreators` → Tracks approved creators.
  * `creatorEarnings` → Tracks earnings for each creator.

---

## 📢 Events

* `SubscriptionPurchased` → Triggered when a subscription is bought.
* `ContentCreated` → Triggered when content is published.
* `ContentAccessed` → Triggered when content is accessed.
* `EarningsWithdrawn` → Triggered when a creator withdraws earnings.

These events help in **tracking and logging activities** transparently on the blockchain.

---

## 🔄 Example Workflow

1. **Owner** sets subscription price and approves content creators.
2. **User** purchases a subscription (e.g., Tier 2 = Premium).
3. **Creator** uploads new content requiring Tier 2.
4. **User** accesses content → subscription verified → creator gets rewarded.
5. **Creator** withdraws earnings.
6. **Owner** withdraws platform fees.

---

## ✅ Advantages of This Contract

* **Transparency**: All payments, subscriptions, and earnings are visible on-chain.
* **Security**: Uses modifiers and access control to prevent misuse.
* **Fair Revenue Sharing**: 90% to creators, 10% to the platform.
* **Automation**: No manual tracking; everything is enforced via code.
* **Decentralized Storage**: Uses IPFS or encrypted references for content hosting.

---

## 🚀 Real-World Use Cases

* **Decentralized Streaming Platform** (like Netflix/Spotify but on blockchain).
* **E-Learning Platforms** where teachers upload premium courses.
* **Subscription Newsletters** with tiered access.
* **Exclusive Communities** with gated content based on subscription level.
